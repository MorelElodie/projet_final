I decided to work on two bumblbebee species: Bombus ruderatus and Bombus argillaceus.

Both species are known to never occur in the same location. In switzerland, both species' distributions are very
distinct, with Bombus argillaceus being present almost exclusively in the Vallée du Rhône, and Bombus ruderatus
being present everywhere else. 

In this project, i will investigate whether both species have different niches and if some environmental variables
can explain these distinct distributions.
